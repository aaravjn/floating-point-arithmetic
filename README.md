# Floating Point Arithmetic

### Task:-
To **Add/Subtract** or **Multiply** two floating point numbers in a custom format

### Format of the floating point numbers:-
The format is very much similar to IEEE 754 format.
The floating point number is **32 bits**, and the **first bit** is reserved for **sign-bit**. The following **12 bits** are for exponents in 2's complement format, and the rest **19 bits** are for **mantissa** in normalized form.

The final result is stored in the memory.
